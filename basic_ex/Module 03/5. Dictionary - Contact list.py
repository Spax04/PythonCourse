# In this exercise, we will work with dictionary operations and methods to create a program that manages a contact list. We will use dictionaries to store the contact information, including the name, phone number, and email address.
#
# Your task is to write the code that allows the user to perform the following operations on the contact list:
# •	Add a new contact.
# •	Display all contacts.
# •	Search for a contact by name.
# •	Update a contact's phone number.
# •	Remove a contact.
# •
# Once you have completed the code, test it by performing the specified operations on the contact list.
