# In this exercise, we will work with tuple operations and methods to create a program that manages a student database. We will use tuples to store the student information and perform various operations on the student records.
#
# Your task is to write the code that allows the user to perform the following operations on a student database:
# •	Add a new student record.
# •	Display all student records.
# •	Search for a student by name.
# •	Update a student's grade.
# •	Remove a student record.
#
# Once you have completed the code, test it by performing the specified operations on the student database.

# Initialize an empty student database
student_database = []

while True:
    print("Menu:")
    print("1. Add new student record")
    print("2. Display all student records")
    print("3. Search student by name")
    print("4. Update student grade")
    print("5. Remove student record")
    print("6. Quit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-6): ")

    if choice == "1":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "2":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "3":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "4":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "5":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "6":

# Your code here


print("Thank you for using the student database manager!")
