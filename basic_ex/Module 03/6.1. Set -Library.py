# In this exercise, we will work with set operations to create a program that manages a library's book borrowing system. We will use sets to store the book titles that are currently borrowed by library patrons.
#
# Your task is to write the code that allows the librarian to perform the following operations on the book borrowing system:
# •	Add a book to the system as being borrowed by a patron.
# •	Display all books currently borrowed.
# •	Check if a book is currently borrowed.
# •	Remove a book from the system once it is returned by the patron.
#
# Once you have completed the code, test it by performing the specified operations on the book borrowing system.

# Initialize an empty set for the borrowed books
borrowed_books = set()
