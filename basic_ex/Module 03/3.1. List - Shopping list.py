# In this exercise, we will work with string formatting and list operations to create a program that manages a shopping list. We will use string formatting to display the shopping list and perform various operations on it using list methods.
#
# Your task is to write the code that allows the user to perform the following operations on a shopping list:
#
# Add items to the shopping list.
# Remove items from the shopping list.
# Display the current shopping list.
# Once you have completed the code, test it by performing the specified operations on the shopping list.


# Initialize an empty shopping list
shopping_list = []

while True:
    print("Menu:")
    print("1. Add item to shopping list")
    print("2. Remove item from shopping list")
    print("3. Display shopping list")
    print("4. Quit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

    if choice == "1":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "2":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "3":

    # Your code here

    elif choice == "4":

# Your code here


print("Thank you for using the shopping list manager!")
