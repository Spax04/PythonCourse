# In this exercise, we will work with tuples to create a program that manages a simple product inventory. We will use tuples to store the product information, including the product name, price, and quantity.
#
# Your task is to write the code that performs the following operations on the product inventory without using a menu:
# •	Add products to the inventory.
# •	Display the current inventory.
# •	Update the quantity of a product.
# •	Remove products from the inventory.
#
# Once you have completed the code, test it by performing the specified operations on the product inventory.

# Initialize an empty product inventory
inventory = []

# Add products to the inventory

# Your code here


# Display the current inventory

# Your code here


# Update the quantity of a product

# Your code here


# Remove products from the inventory

# Your code here


# Display the updated inventory

# Your code here
