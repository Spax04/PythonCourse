# 4.	Replace a specific word in the comment with another word.
#
# Here are the steps to follow:
#
# 1.	Ask the user to enter a comment.
# 2.	Use a while loop to repeat the following operations until the user chooses to exit:
# •	Display a menu of options to the user:
#   o	Count characters
#   o	Count words
#   o	Check word presence
#   o	Replace word
#   o	Exit
# •	Ask the user to select an option by entering the corresponding number.
# •	Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.
# •	Display the result to the user.
