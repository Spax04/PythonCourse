# You are now challenged to create a more advanced program that simulates a contact management system using dictionaries, while and for loops, if and else operators, and functions. The program should allow users to perform various operations on a contact list, including adding, removing, updating, and searching for contacts. Additionally, the program should provide functionality to sort and display the contacts based on specific criteria.
#
# The program should include the following features:
#
# 1.	Initialize an empty contact list dictionary.
# 2.	Add contacts to the list along with their names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
# 3.	Remove contacts from the list.
# 4.	Update the phone number and email address of existing contacts.
# 5.	Display the current contact list with detailed information for each contact.
# 6.	Search for a specific contact by name and display their information.
# 7.	Sort and display the contact list alphabetically by name or by phone number.
#
# To make the exercise more challenging, try to modularize your code by creating functions for each operation and utilize appropriate control structures.
