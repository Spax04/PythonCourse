# You are working at a grocery store, and your manager has assigned you a task to manage the inventory of fruits. You need to create a program that allows you to perform various operations on a tuple containing the names of different fruits. Your program should provide a menu-based interface for the user to select and perform different operations.
#
# Here are the operations you need to implement:
#
# 1.	Print the list of fruits.
# 2.	Check if a specific fruit is present in the list.
# 3.	Count the number of occurrences of a specific fruit.
# 4.	Find the index of a specific fruit.
# 5.	Sort the fruits in alphabetical order.
# 6.	Exit the program.
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1.	Create a tuple called "fruits" containing at least 5 different fruit names.
# 2.	Display a menu to the user with the available operations (1-6).
# 3.	Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.
# 4.	Use a while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit (option 6).
#
# Hints:
#
# •	You can use a for loop to iterate over the fruits tuple for certain operations.
# •	Use if and else statements to handle different menu choices.
# •	You can define separate functions for each operation to keep the code organized and modular.
