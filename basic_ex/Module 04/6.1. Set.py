# You are a teacher managing a class of students. Your task is to keep track of students who have submitted their assignments. You will create a program that allows you to perform set operations on the students' submission status. The program should have the following functionalities:
#
# •	Add students to the set of submissions.
# •	Remove students from the set of submissions.
# •	Check if a student has submitted their assignment.
# •	Count the number of students who have submitted their assignments.
# •	Display the list of students who have not submitted their assignments.
#
# To accomplish this, you need to create a menu-driven program that provides options to perform these operations. The program should continue executing until the user chooses to exit.
