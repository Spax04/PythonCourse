# You have been hired as a data scientist at a research institute, and your task is to develop a program that analyzes a dataset containing information about patients' medical records. The dataset is represented as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a patient's record with keys such as 'name', 'age', 'gender', 'diagnosis', and 'treatments'. Your task is to write a Python program that implements the following features:
#
# 1.	Create an empty list to store the patient records.
# 2.	Use a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit.
# 3.	Display the menu options to the user: "Add patient record", "Search patients", "Analyze data", and "Quit".
# 4.	Use if-else statements to execute the corresponding operation based on the user's choice.
# 5.	For the "Add patient record" option, prompt the user to enter the patient's information and add it as a dictionary to the list of patient records.
# 6.	For the "Search patients" option, prompt the user to enter a search keyword and display the patient records that match the keyword in any of the keys.
# 7.	For the "Analyze data" option, calculate and display the average age of the patients in the dataset.
# 8.	If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message.
# 9.
# Remember to use list operations and methods, while and for loops, if and else operators, and functions to implement this program.
