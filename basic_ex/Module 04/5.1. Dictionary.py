# You are now tasked with creating an advanced program for an online bookstore that includes a more complex inventory management system. The program should incorporate dictionary operations and methods, while and for loops, if and else operators, as well as functions. The program should provide additional functionality, such as calculating the total value of the inventory and generating a report based on specific criteria.
#
# The program should include the following features:
#
# 1.	Initialize an empty inventory dictionary.
# 2.	Add books to the inventory along with their titles, authors, quantities, and prices.
# 3.	Remove books from the inventory.
# 4.	Update the quantity and price of existing books in the inventory.
# 5.	Display the current inventory with detailed information for each book.
# 6.	Check if a specific book is present in the inventory.
# 7.	Calculate the total value of the inventory (quantity multiplied by price) and display it.
# 8.	Generate a report of books with quantities below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 copies).
#
# To make the exercise more challenging, try to modularize your code by creating functions for each operation and utilize appropriate control structures.
