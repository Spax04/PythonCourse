# You have been hired as a data analyst at a company that specializes in analyzing social media data. Your task is to write a Python program that performs various operations on a list of tweets. The program should allow you to filter and analyze the tweets based on certain criteria. Your task is to implement the following features:
#
# 1.	Create an empty list to store the tweets.
# 2.	Use a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit.
# 3.	Display the menu options to the user: "Add tweet", "Filter tweets", "Analyze tweets", and "Quit".
# 4.	Use if-else statements to execute the corresponding operation based on the user's choice.
# 5.	For the "Add tweet" option, prompt the user to enter a tweet and add it to the list.
# 6.	For the "Filter tweets" option, prompt the user to enter a keyword and display only the tweets that contain that keyword.
# 7.	For the "Analyze tweets" option, calculate and display the average length of the tweets in the list.
# 8.	If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message.
# Remember to use list operations and methods, while and for loops, if and else operators, and functions to implement this program.
