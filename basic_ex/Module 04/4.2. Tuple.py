# You are working as a manager at a clothing store, and you need to create a program to manage the inventory of different clothing items. Your program should allow you to perform various operations on a tuple of clothing items, such as adding new items, updating quantities, and generating sales reports. The program should provide a menu-based interface for the user to select and perform different operations.
#
# Here are the operations you need to implement:
#
# 1.	Print the list of clothing items and their quantities.
# 2.	Check if a specific clothing item is in stock.
# 3.	Update the quantity of a specific clothing item.
# 4.	Generate a sales report for a specific clothing item.
# 5.	Add a new clothing item to the inventory.
# 6.	Exit the program.
#
# Instructions:
#
# •	Create a tuple called "inventory" containing at least 5 different clothing items as tuples. Each clothing item tuple should consist of the item name and its quantity.
# •	Display a menu to the user with the available operations (1-6).
# •	Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding operation.
# •	Use a while loop to repeatedly display the menu until the user chooses to exit (option 6).
#
# Hints:
#
# •	Use a for loop to iterate over the inventory tuple for certain operations.
# •	You can use if and else statements to handle different menu choices.
# •	To update the quantity of a specific item, you can convert the inventory tuple to a list, update the quantity, and then convert it back to a tuple.
