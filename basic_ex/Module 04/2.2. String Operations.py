# You have been hired by a local restaurant to develop a menu management system. The restaurant owner wants you to create a program that allows the staff to add, edit, and delete menu items. Your task is to write a Python program that implements the following features:
#
# •	Display the menu options to the user: "Add item", "Edit item", "Delete item", "Display menu", and "Quit".
# •	Use a while loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to quit.
# •	Use if-else statements to execute the corresponding operation based on the user's choice.
# •	For the "Add item" option, prompt the user to enter the name of the menu item and add it to the menu.
# •	For the "Edit item" option, prompt the user to enter the name of the menu item they want to edit and then the new name for the item.
# •	For the "Delete item" option, prompt the user to enter the name of the menu item they want to delete and remove it from the menu.
# •	For the "Display menu" option, print out all the menu items.
# •	If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message.
# •	Remember to use string operations and methods, while and for loops, if and else operators, and functions to implement this program.
