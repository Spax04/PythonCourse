# In this exercise, you will learn how to integrate Cython, ctypes, Elmer, and Weave in a Python program. These tools are commonly used for optimizing and accelerating code execution in scientific computing and numerical simulations.
#
# Problem Statement:
#
# You are given a Python program that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers. However, the program is quite slow and needs optimization. Your task is to modify the program using Cython, ctypes, Elmer, and Weave to improve its performance.
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1.	Install the required libraries:
# •	Cython: Use the command pip install cython.
# •	ctypes: No separate installation required as it is a part of the Python standard library.
# •	Elmer: Download and install Elmer from the official website (https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer).
# •	Weave: Use the command pip install weave.
# 2.	Create a new Python file, e.g., optimization.py, and import the necessary libraries:
#
# 3.	Define a Python function, sum_of_squares, that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers:
#
# 4.	Convert the sum_of_squares function to Cython by adding type annotations and using Cython syntax. Save this as sum_of_squares.pyx:
#
# 5.	Create a C library from the Cython code using the pyximport module. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
#
# 6.	Use ctypes to load the C library and call the sum_of_squares_cython function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:
#
# 7.	Use Elmer to compile the C library. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
#
# 8.	Use Weave to optimize the original Python function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:
#
# 9.	Test the program by creating a list of numbers and calling the sum_of_squares function. For example:




# Install the required libraries:
#
# Cython: Use the command pip install cython.
# ctypes: No separate installation required as it is a part of the Python standard library.
# Elmer: Download and install Elmer from the official website (https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer).
# Weave: Use the command pip install weave.


# Create a new Python file, e.g., optimization.py, and import the necessary libraries:
import cython
from ctypes import *
import elmer
import weave

# Define a Python function, sum_of_squares, that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers:

def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    result = 0
    for num in numbers:
        result += num ** 2
    return result
# Convert the sum_of_squares function to Cython by adding type annotations and using Cython syntax. Save this as sum_of_squares.pyx:
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    cdef int result = 0
    cdef int num
    for num in numbers:
        result += num ** 2
    return result
# Create a C library from the Cython code using the pyximport module. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
pyximport.install()

import sum_of_squares
# Use ctypes to load the C library and call the sum_of_squares_cython function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:

def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    sum_of_squares_cython = sum_of_squares.sum_of_squares
    sum_of_squares_cython.argtypes = [POINTER(c_int)]
    sum_of_squares_cython.restype = c_int

    arr = (c_int * len(numbers))(*numbers)
    return sum_of_squares_cython(arr)
# Use Elmer to compile the C library. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
elmer.compile("sum_of_squares.c", ["sum_of_squares.pyx"])
# Use Weave to optimize the original Python function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:

def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    code = """
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        result += numbers[i] * numbers[i];
    }
    return_val = result;
    """
    result = weave.inline(code, ['numbers'], type_converters=weave.converters.blitz)
    return result
# Test the program by creating a list of numbers and calling the sum_of_squares function. For example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_squares(numbers))
# Note: The provided code assumes that you have correctly installed the required libraries and set up the environment for Cython, ctypes, Elmer, and Weave. Make sure to adjust the code as per your specific setup and requirements.
#
# Remember to compile the Cython code using python setup.py build_ext --inplace before executing the program.
