If you're running the code on a Windows machine and you have an alternative compression utility installed, such as 7-Zip, you can modify the code to use the appropriate command-line tool. For example, instead of zip, you could use 7z (the command-line version of 7-Zip). Make sure the alternative utility is installed and accessible from the command prompt.

If you're using Windows and want to use the zip command specifically, you'll need to install a utility that provides the zip command. One option is to use a program like Info-ZIP, which provides a Windows version of the zip command. You can download it from the Info-ZIP website (http://infozip.sourceforge.net/) and make sure the executable is added to your system's PATH.

If you're using a Unix-based system (Linux or macOS), make sure the zip command is installed. You can typically install it using the package manager specific to your operating system (e.g., apt-get on Ubuntu).

Make sure to choose the option that best suits your needs and ensure that the appropriate compression utility is installed and accessible from the command line.
