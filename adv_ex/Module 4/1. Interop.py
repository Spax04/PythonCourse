# In this exercise, you will learn how to integrate Cython, ctypes, Elmer, and Weave in a Python program. These tools are commonly used for optimizing and accelerating code execution in scientific computing and numerical simulations.
#
# Problem Statement:
#
# You are given a Python program that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers. However, the program is quite slow and needs optimization. Your task is to modify the program using Cython, ctypes, Elmer, and Weave to improve its performance.
#
# Instructions:
#
# 1.	Install the required libraries:
# •	Cython: Use the command pip install cython.
# •	ctypes: No separate installation required as it is a part of the Python standard library.
# •	Elmer: Download and install Elmer from the official website (https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer).
# •	Weave: Use the command pip install weave.
# 2.	Create a new Python file, e.g., optimization.py, and import the necessary libraries:
#
# 3.	Define a Python function, sum_of_squares, that calculates the sum of squares of a given list of numbers:
#
# 4.	Convert the sum_of_squares function to Cython by adding type annotations and using Cython syntax. Save this as sum_of_squares.pyx:
#
# 5.	Create a C library from the Cython code using the pyximport module. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
#
# 6.	Use ctypes to load the C library and call the sum_of_squares_cython function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:
#
# 7.	Use Elmer to compile the C library. Add the following code to the optimization.py file:
#
# 8.	Use Weave to optimize the original Python function. Replace the existing sum_of_squares function with the following code:
#
# 9.	Test the program by creating a list of numbers and calling the sum_of_squares function. For example:


import cython
from ctypes import *
import elmer
import weave


def sum_of_squares(numbers):


# Your code here


pyximport.install()

import sum_of_squares


def sum_of_squares(numbers):


# Your code here


elmer.compile("sum_of_squares.c", ["sum_of_squares.pyx"])


def sum_of_squares(numbers):


# Your code here


numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum_of_squares(numbers))
