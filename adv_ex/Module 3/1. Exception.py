# Let's level up the calculator application you developed earlier. In addition to performing basic mathematical operations, the calculator should now support advanced calculations involving exponentiation and square root. However, you need to handle multiple types of exceptions that may occur during these calculations.
#
# The Calculator class should have the following methods:
#
# 1.	add(x, y): This method should take two numbers, x and y, as input and return their sum.
#
# 2.	subtract(x, y): This method should take two numbers, x and y, as input and return the result of subtracting y from x.
#
# 3.	multiply(x, y): This method should take two numbers, x and y, as input and return their product.
#
# 4.	divide(x, y): This method should take two numbers, x and y, as input and return the result of dividing x by y. Handle the ZeroDivisionError exception if y is zero and return a meaningful error message.
#
# 5.	exponentiation(x, y): This method should take two numbers, x and y, as input and return the result of raising x to the power of y. Handle the TypeError exception if either x or y is not a valid number and return a meaningful error message.
#
# 6.	square_root(x): This method should take a number x as input and return the square root of x. Handle the ValueError exception if x is negative and return a meaningful error message.
